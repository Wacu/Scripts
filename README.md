Can we detect social anxiety using tweets?

Anxiety has been ranked, globally as one of the leading causes of mental health disability\cite{Choudhary2022}. Anxiety disorder has been classified as a mental illness with the largest group of social and individual burden mental disorders\cite{10665-37108}
Popular types of Anxiety disorder include Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD), Suicidal Tendency (ST), Panic Disorder (PD) , Social mental disturbance (SAD) and Agoraphobia(AG) \cite{Muhammad2020}
The passive use of Social media consists basically of scrolling and browsing other peopleâ€™s lives. This may consequently give birth to a platform for social comparisons and envy, which automatically may put individuals at elevated risk for anxiety and depression\cite{Seabrook2016}.
